# Oli Lite – BETA 1.0.0

**Oli Lite** is a *simple and open source PHP framework* with MySQL integration and URL management tools.  
The framework includes various secondary tools for website development.

This project is a lite version of **Oli**. This main project includes also accounts management, addons support, and more!
Check it out on the [Oli Github Repository](https://github.com/matiboux/Oli/).

If you like any of the two projects, or are interested in it, please consider giving some feedback, and leaving a star! ★  
You can also get involved and contribute, if you'd like to! You're more than welcome to do so!

## Get started!

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/matiboux/Oli/releases/latest) and extract the files in your web server with PHP installed.  
Create your website pages in the *content/* folder and check them appear live on your website!

### Configuration

To ensure your website works properly, and to benefit from the settings management feature, either create an *app.json* file in your directory or use a mysql database.

If you choose to create the *app.json* file, copy this in the file and edit the values.  
`{"url":"urwebs.it\/","name":"Your website","description":"","creation_date":"","owner":""}`  
Do not specify the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) for the url value.

If you choose to use a mysql database, import the default sql file and update the value from the "settings" table.

If you need to configure additional stuff, or if you'd like a global code applying to all your website, you can create a *config.php* file. This file will be automatically included during loading.
